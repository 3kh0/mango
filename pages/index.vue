    <p class="text-lg mt-4">
      I am a 16 year old software developer, hacker, furry, cybersecurity
      enthusiast, and privacy activist living in burger land. I like to make
      cool things, obseess over privacy, and learn new things.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-10">Things I can do</h1>
    <p>
      I am a front-end software developer, so I know my way around HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript pretty well. I am also good with web frameworks such as
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>,
      <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>, and
      <a href="https://nuxt.com/">Nuxt</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Backend development is not my strong suit, but I still know how to use
      things like <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>,
      <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>,
      <a href="https://mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, and a few other lesser-known
      technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from web development, I sometimes mess with the source engine and
      <a href="https://sourcemod.net/">SourceMod</a> making mods and plugins for
      games like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/">Counter-Strike</a>.
      Most of these are just for fun, so don't expect them to be public any time
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a good system admin too (according to my objective opinion), and I
      have a lot of experience with server management,
      <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> and
      <a href="https://squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity and exploit hunting are fields I am slowly working on. I
      have participated in one responsible disclosure program with
      <a href="https://hackerone.com/3kh0">HackerOne</a> and hope to do more
      soon.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-10">Other cool things</h1>
    <p>
      Privacy is a big deal to me, so I donate to or volunteer with
      organizations like the <a href="https://signal.org">Signal Foundation</a>,
      <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/">AccessNow</a>, the
      <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, the
      <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor Project</a>,
      <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup</a>,
      <a href="https://tails.net/">TailsOS</a>, the
      <a href="https://ccs.getmonero.org/">Monero Project</a>,
      <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/">Amnesty International</a>, and
      <a href="https://fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a>. I also
      run/sponsor several Tor and Monero nodes for the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also happen to be a furry! My fursona is a silly little fox boy with
      three tails. If you'd like to learn more and see art of him, check out my
      <a href="https://extra.3kh0.net/fursona">fursona page</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a blog where I post about random things. You can check it out
      at <a href="https://blog.3kh0.net">blog.3kh0.net</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-10">Is that all?</h1>
